- simple shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hsh is a command interpreter modeled after early Unix shells, such as the Thompson, Korn or C shells. It allows a user to interface with the kernel by entering commands into their terminal. Running in interactive mode, hsh first prompts the user to submit a command line. It then parses this input for a valid command and executes it accordingly. Users may also pipe the output of external programs into the hsh shell, causing it to run in non-interactive mode. In this mode, the shell does not solicit user input and will automatically exit upon execution of the commands received. The hsh shell features the 
.B exit
,
.B env
, and 
.B cd
builtin commands.

.PP
.SH BUILT-INS
.PP
.B exit
- Terminates the current shell session. 
.B exit
allows the user to designate an exit status by passing it as an argument to the command. This status must be a number between 
.B 0 
and 
.B INT_MAX.
.PP
.B env
- Prints the current environment to the terminal
.PP
.B cd
- Changes the current working directory. The user may specify the target directory by passing it as an argument to cd or by passing one of the following pre-defined arguments:  
.B .
, 
.B ..
,  
.B ~
, 
.B -
, and 
.B ~[username].
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
When terminating the hsh shell in a prescribed manner ( 
.B exit
built-in or 
.B EOF
), the exit status will be set to
.B EXIT_SUCCESS.
The user may designate a specific exit status by passing it as an argument to the 
.B exit
built-in. In this case, the exit status will be set to this argument. However, if the number specified by the user is out of range (
.B 0
to
.B INT_MAX
) , hsh will set the exit status to  
.B EXIT_FAILURE.
